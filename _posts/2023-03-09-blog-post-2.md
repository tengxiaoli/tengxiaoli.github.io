The blog contains a summary of the non-singular elasticity theory.

# General Elasticity

Basically, every physical laws are under the control of thermodynamics principles. And so is the elasticity theory. The governing equations are as follows:

$$
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{ij,i}=\partial_{i}C_{ijkl}\epsilon_{kl}=C_{ijkl}u_{k,li}=0
\end{equation}
$$

which is the minimaztion of the total energy in the form of:

$$
\begin{equation}
W=\frac{1}{2}C_{ijkl}\epsilon_{ij}\epsilon_{kl}
\end{equation}
$$

# Non-singular / Non-sudden change Elasticity

Considering a different energy formula given by $W(\epsilon_{ij},\epsilon_{ij,k})$ as follows:

$$
\begin{equation}
W=\frac{1}{2}C_{ijkl}\epsilon_{ij}\epsilon_{kl}
+\frac{1}{2}D_{ijmkln}\epsilon_{ij,m}\epsilon_{kl,n}
\end{equation}
$$

Once you have to minimize the energy formula $Eqa(3)$, the singularity significantly increases the total energy of the system due to the spatial gradient of strain $\epsilon_{ij,m}$. Thus, no **singularity** or **sudden change** is considered to occur in such governing equations' system. 

# Applications
1. Some elasticity problems with discrete nature: non-singular dislocation theory[1];
2. 

# Question
If energy minimization is required, why would sudden change in displacement happen in dislocation theories, which contributes to most of the elastic energy? Is it because of the instrinct definition of dislocation boundary conditions? So, if another definition of dislocation displacement boundary conditions is defined, whether the governing equations $Eqa(3)$ is no longer required.
